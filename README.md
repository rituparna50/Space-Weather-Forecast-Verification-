Using the US Navy's F10.7 Solar irradiance values as metric data for space weather prediction purposes. 

F10.7 solar irradiance is a metric of the solar radio flux per unit frequency at a wavelength of 10.7 centimeters, corresponding to a frequency of 2800 MHz, which originates from solar emissions during high solar activity. It is an excellent indicator of solar activity, particularly solar flares, which can increase the F10.7 level significantly.

The navy uses the F10.7 index as an understanding of the earth's ionosphere for transmitting radio communications and radar performances. Since the ionosphere reflects high frequency radio waves, solar activity which affects the ionosphere's conditions can alter the range of radio transmissions. By monitoring the F10.7 index, the Navy can anticipate and adapt to changes in communication conditions, particularly for systems that rely on HF radio waves.

**For space weather predictions**

High solar activity tends to cause high F10.7 values, which indicate high levels of ionization in the earth's upper atmosphere. This affects sateelites' orbits due to increased drag, disrupt communication sugnals including GPS and also pose a high level or radiation exposure to astronuats. The goal of htis task is to show how F10.7 indices are used as a proxy for predicting solar behavior and as a derived result, larger space weather applications. 

**Standard F10.7 Values**

The range of F10.7 values can be from as low as 70 sfu (solar flux units) to as high as 200 sfu. The low values indicate quiet sun with no or less solar flares etc. And high values indicate an active sun with large amount of flares etc. The lower F10.7 index could be related to the sun being in a solar minimum and the higher values can be related to the Sun being in a solar maximum.
